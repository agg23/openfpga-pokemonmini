Port by agg23. Core by Grieverheart.

A small handheld console released by Nintendo, similar to Tamogachi, but with cartridge-based games. While it possesses a limited official library, it has various homebrew offerings as well that makes this a special little console.

Due to the high potential refresh rate of the LCD (75Hz), the core may experience tearing. A quadruple buffer is used to attempt to mitigate this. Please report all issues to agg23, as most likely any issues experienced are issues with the port, not the core.
